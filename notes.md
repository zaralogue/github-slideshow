## Theia, new developer
### Background
Right now I am in search of work as a software developer. Recently completed a program back in Janruary, intense 3 month process. Prior to that and what led me back to software, got a Bachelors in math, went into education for awhile, experience and moving and life led me reintorduced me to programming. 
Through the program we would use github as our source control. Experience pushing and pull, overing time, team based projects, make our own small based orgs, intro to the ecosystem there. More recently trying to find open source projects to contribute to. Initial introduction was googling, having some projects pop up. 
> My experience searching for open source projects to contribute to via Google was leess than ideal. A lot of those projects were old, out dated, not taking contriubtion, or the issues were well over a year old. 

### Using Explore
The major ones to start through GH, were the trending page, sort through to see if there's anything hot or applicable, changing the timing settings, all time, over time, the trends there. First I sort by language, look at the project name, read through and check ou the read me. After that, if ti still piques my interest, go to issues page, see if they have any good first issues, depending on the size of the code base, any issues in my ballpark, come back to later when you feel a little emore comfortable. I've made a few contribution, mostly to really small projects, as I get more comfortable, look for bigger things. 
> I'm definitely looking for my goldilocks scenario: the right language, project size, and friendliness.
